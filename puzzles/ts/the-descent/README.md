# The Descent

"The Descent" is a beginner-level coding challenge available on the CodinGame platform. In this challenge, the player is a fighter pilot trying to shoot down mountains that are blocking their way.

The player is given an array of integers representing the heights of mountains in the player's path. The player's goal is to shoot down the highest mountain, which is represented by the maximum value in the array.

The player has a limited amount of ammunition and can only fire at one mountain at a time. Each shot takes one unit of ammunition, and the mountain that is hit is destroyed, reducing its height to zero.

The challenge consists of writing a program that takes as input the heights of the mountains and outputs the index of the highest mountain that the player should shoot at to destroy it.

The challenge is designed to help players learn and practice programming skills such as array manipulation, searching for maximum values, and generating output. It is a fun and engaging way to improve programming skills while solving a challenging and entertaining puzzle.
