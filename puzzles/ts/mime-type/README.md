# MIME Type

"MIME Type" is a beginner-level coding challenge available on the CodinGame platform. In this challenge, the player is given a list of file names and their corresponding MIME types, and is asked to determine the MIME type of a given file name.

A MIME type is a type of Internet standard that is used to indicate the type of data that a file contains. It is typically represented as a two-part identifier, with the first part indicating the type of data (such as "image" or "text") and the second part indicating the specific format or subtype (such as "jpeg" or "html").

The challenge consists of writing a program that takes as input a list of file names and their corresponding MIME types, as well as the name of a file, and outputs the corresponding MIME type for that file. If the file type is not known, the program should output "UNKNOWN".

The challenge is designed to help players learn and practice programming skills such as string manipulation, conditional statements, and data structures. It is a fun and engaging way to improve programming skills while solving a challenging and entertaining puzzle.
