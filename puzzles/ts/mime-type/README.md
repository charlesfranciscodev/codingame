# MIME Type

In this puzzle, we have to associate file names with MIME types.
For example, `animated.gif` is of type `image/gif`.
The idea is to extract the extension from the file name, `.gif`, in this case and map it to its type.
If the file name has no extension or the extension is unknown, we simply print `UNKNOWN`.
