# ASCII Art

"ASCII Art" is a beginner-level coding challenge available on the CodinGame platform. In this challenge, the player is given a string of characters and a font size, and is asked to generate an ASCII art representation of the string using ASCII characters.

The ASCII art output should be a sequence of lines, each line representing a row of the output. Each row should contain the ASCII characters that correspond to the input string, with each character expanded to the specified font size. If a character in the input string is not a letter or cannot be represented in ASCII art, it should be replaced with a question mark.

The challenge consists of writing a program that takes as input the string of characters, the font size, and the ASCII art characters to be used for each letter, and outputs the corresponding ASCII art representation.

The challenge is designed to help players learn and practice programming skills such as string manipulation, input/output handling, and ASCII art rendering. It is a fun and engaging way to improve programming skills while solving a challenging and entertaining puzzle.
