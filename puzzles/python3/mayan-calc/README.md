# MAYAN CALCULATION

This puzzle aims to test your skills in string manipulation, particularly in operations such as splitting, concatenation, and conversion. By solving this puzzle, you will demonstrate your ability to handle string manipulation tasks effectively. Additionally, you may also learn about the vigesimal system, which is the base twenty numeral system used by the Mayans.

To solve this puzzle, you will need to understand concepts related to strings and the radix, which refers to the number of unique digits (including zero) used in a positional numeral system. For instance, in the decimal system, the radix is ten because it uses the digits 0 through 9.

The puzzle involves performing an arithmetic operation using two Mayan numbers. It introduces you to computation in the base 20 system utilized by the Mayans. You will need to work extensively with string-to-digits conversions and mechanisms for storing their values in associative arrays. These concepts will help you successfully solve the puzzle and improve your skills in string manipulation and radix computation.
