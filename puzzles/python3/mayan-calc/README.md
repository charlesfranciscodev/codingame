# MAYAN CALCULATION

This puzzle aims to test your skills in string manipulation, particularly in operations such as splitting, concatenation, and conversion. By solving this puzzle, you will demonstrate your ability to handle string manipulation tasks effectively. Additionally, you may also learn about the vigesimal system, which is the base twenty numeral system used by the Mayans.

To solve this puzzle, you will need to understand concepts related to strings and the radix, which refers to the number of unique digits (including zero) used in a positional numeral system. For instance, in the decimal system, the radix is ten because it uses the digits 0 through 9.

The puzzle involves performing an arithmetic operation using two Mayan numbers. It introduces you to computation in the base 20 system utilized by the Mayans. You will need to work extensively with string-to-digits conversions and mechanisms for storing their values in associative arrays. These concepts will help you successfully solve the puzzle and improve your skills in string manipulation and radix computation.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Understanding Mayan Numbers:**
   - *Tip:* Familiarize yourself with the Mayan numeral system, particularly how they represent different powers of 20. This understanding is crucial for decoding and performing arithmetic operations.

2. **String Manipulation Techniques:**
   - *Tip:* Brush up on your string manipulation skills, including splitting and concatenating strings. Mayan numbers are likely represented as strings, and you'll need to manipulate them to perform the required arithmetic.

3. **Associative Arrays for Value Storage:**
   - *Tip:* Utilize associative arrays (dictionaries or hash maps) to efficiently store and retrieve values associated with Mayan digits. This will make it easier to convert between string representations and numerical values.

4. **Radix Conversion Logic:**
   - *Tip:* Develop a robust logic for converting Mayan numbers into a base-10 (decimal) equivalent. Understand how to extract values for each positional unit in the Mayan system and convert them to decimal form for arithmetic operations.

5. **Iterative Approaches with Loops:**
   - *Tip:* Leverage loops effectively to iterate through Mayan digits and perform necessary computations. Loops can streamline the process of converting, manipulating, and operating on Mayan numbers.

These tips should provide a good starting point for tackling the puzzle, emphasizing the importance of Mayan numeral understanding, string manipulation, associative arrays, radix conversion, and iterative approaches with loops. Good luck!
