# Mars Lander - Episode 1

"Mars Lander - Episode 1" is a beginner-level coding challenge available on the CodinGame platform. In this challenge, the player takes on the role of a spaceship pilot trying to safely land a spacecraft on the surface of Mars.

The player is given the coordinates and the speed of the spacecraft, as well as the angle of its trajectory and the thrust power to be used to adjust its speed and direction. The objective is to write a program that computes the optimal thrust power and angle for the spacecraft to land safely on the surface of Mars without crashing or running out of fuel.

The challenge consists of writing a program that takes as input the current state of the spacecraft and outputs the thrust power and angle that should be used to adjust its trajectory and speed for a safe landing. The program needs to take into account the gravitational pull of Mars, the speed of the spacecraft, the remaining fuel, and the altitude of the spacecraft above the surface of Mars.

The challenge is designed to help players learn and practice programming skills such as physics calculations, conditional statements, and input/output handling. It is a fun and engaging way to improve programming skills while solving a challenging and entertaining puzzle.
