# Vox Codei - Episode 1

## Problem Description

In this puzzle, you are tasked with infiltrating a central computer's firewall interface to destroy surveillance nodes using fork-bombs. The interface is represented as a rectangular grid with various characters, including surveillance nodes (@) and indestructible/passive nodes (#). Your objective is to destroy all the surveillance nodes within a limited number of turns by strategically placing and detonating fork-bombs.

## Rules

1. The game is played on a rectangular grid with variable width and height.
2. Surveillance nodes (@) and indestructible nodes (#) are present on the grid.
3. You start with a fixed number of fork-bombs.
4. Each turn, you can either place a fork-bomb on an empty cell (.) or wait.
5. Fork-bombs explode after 3 turns or when triggered by the explosion of another fork-bomb.
6. The explosion of a fork-bomb creates a cross-shaped blast with a range of 3 cells, destroying all nodes (surveillance nodes) it comes into contact with, but not passing through indestructible nodes (#).
7. You cannot place a bomb on a node, only on empty cells.
8. The game has a limited number of turns to destroy all surveillance nodes. Failing to do so results in detection and a loss.

## Solution Summary

To win this puzzle and destroy all surveillance nodes within the allotted turns, follow these steps:

1. **Plan Your Strategy:** Examine the grid layout and identify the locations of surveillance nodes and indestructible nodes. Plan your bomb placements accordingly.

2. **Use Fork-Bombs Wisely:** Place fork-bombs strategically on empty cells, with the goal of maximizing the number of surveillance nodes destroyed in each explosion. Consider the 3-turn timer for fork-bombs.

3. **Chain Explosions:** If possible, trigger the explosion of one fork-bomb with another. This can help you efficiently clear a large area of surveillance nodes in a single turn.

4. **Avoid Wasting Bombs:** Ensure that your bomb placements are precise, as you have a limited number of bombs. Don't waste them on empty areas without surveillance nodes.

5. **Account for Indestructible Nodes:** Remember that fork-bomb explosions cannot pass through indestructible nodes, so plan your bomb placements accordingly to work around them.

6. **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the number of turns remaining and the number of surveillance nodes left. Manage your bomb placements and detonations to meet the victory conditions within the given time frame.

7. **Adapt to Grid Variations:** Be adaptable as the grid dimensions may vary in each game. Your strategy needs to accommodate these variations.

By following these guidelines and using a combination of careful planning and efficient bomb placement, you can successfully destroy all surveillance nodes and achieve victory in the game while avoiding detection.
