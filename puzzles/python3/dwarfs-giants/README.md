# DWARFS STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS

In this puzzle, you will learn about oriented graph data structures and how to solve them using a Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. The puzzle focuses on concepts such as memoization, recursion, and graphs.

The objective of the puzzle is to calculate the height of a directed graph data structure. By solving this puzzle, you will understand how to construct a tree and utilize a recursive algorithm to determine the longest chain of nodes. The underlying graph theory involved in this algorithm is a crucial aspect of programming.
