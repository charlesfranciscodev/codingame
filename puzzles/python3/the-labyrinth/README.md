# The Labyrinth

To solve this puzzle, we must first explore the entire maze with Kirk. This can be done by searching for unknown positions on the map to reveal them. Once we know the maze layout, we can go the control room and deactivate the control beam. This will activate the alarm, which will kill Kirk after a time limit. Then, we can go back to the starting position with an optimal path generated by an algorithm like <a href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/BFS">BFS</a>.
