# The Fall - Episode 1

The puzzle requires solving a labyrinth by predicting the path a character will take based on the topology of the rooms. The solution to this exercise heavily relies on the correct usage of associative arrays (also known as hash tables) and storing values in a 2D array (two-dimensional array).

To solve the puzzle in Python, you'll need to implement the following concepts:

1. Associative Array: An associative array is a data structure that maps keys to values. In this puzzle, it is used to create links between arbitrary types (room positions) and directions (possible movement directions).

2. Multidimensional Array (2D Array): A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element can be accessed using two indices. It is used to store the topology of the labyrinth and represent the rooms.

By correctly managing associative arrays and creating the right associations, you can create an efficient solution. With proper implementation, the final code for solving the puzzle could be relatively short.

To solve the puzzle, you'll need to apply the knowledge of associative arrays and 2D arrays in Python to navigate the labyrinth and predict the character's path accurately.
