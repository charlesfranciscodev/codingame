# DON'T PANIC - EPISODE 1

This Python code appears to be a script for a game or simulation involving elevators and clones. Let's go through the code and document its functionality:

```python
from typing import Dict

if __name__ == "__main__":
```
The code begins with a check to see if the module is being run as the main script.

```python
    elevators: Dict[int, int] = {}
```
This line initializes an empty dictionary called `elevators`, which will store the positions of elevators on different floors. The keys represent the floor numbers, and the values represent the elevator positions on those floors.

```python
    _, _, _, exit_floor, exit_pos, _, _, n5 = map(int, input().split())
```
This line reads input values from the user, splitting them by spaces and converting them to integers using the `map` function. The input values are assigned to the corresponding variables: `exit_floor`, `exit_pos`, and `n5`. The other variables are ignored (indicated by `_`).

```python
    for _ in range(n5):
        elevator_floor, elevator_pos = map(int, input().split())
        elevators[elevator_floor] = elevator_pos
```
This loop reads `n5` sets of elevator floor and position values from the user. The values are split and converted to integers using `map`. Each elevator floor and position pair is stored in the `elevators` dictionary.

```python
    # For the last floor, we use the exit instead of an elevator.
    elevators[exit_floor] = exit_pos
```
This line assigns the `exit_pos` value to the `exit_floor` key in the `elevators` dictionary. This means that the last floor is treated as if it has an elevator at the `exit_pos` position.

```python
    while True:
        line = input().split()
        clone_floor = int(line[0])
        clone_pos = int(line[1])
        direction = line[2]
```
This loop continuously reads input from the user. Each line of input is split into a list of strings using `split()`. The first item in the list is converted to an integer and assigned to `clone_floor`, the second item is converted to an integer and assigned to `clone_pos`, and the third item is assigned to `direction`.

```python
        if clone_floor == -1:
            print("WAIT")
```
If `clone_floor` is equal to -1, the program prints "WAIT".

```python
        elif direction == "LEFT" and clone_pos < elevators[clone_floor]:
            print("BLOCK")
```
If `direction` is "LEFT" and `clone_pos` is less than the position of the elevator on `clone_floor`, the program prints "BLOCK".

```python
        elif direction == "RIGHT" and clone_pos > elevators[clone_floor]:
            print("BLOCK")
```
If `direction` is "RIGHT" and `clone_pos` is greater than the position of the elevator on `clone_floor`, the program prints "BLOCK".

```python
        else:
            print("WAIT")
```
If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "WAIT".

This code seems to implement a simple logic to determine whether a clone should wait or be blocked based on the clone's floor, position, and direction, as well as the positions of elevators and the exit.
