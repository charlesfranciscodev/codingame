# The Bridge

## Summary

The puzzle involves controlling 1 to 4 motorbikes on a bridge with 4 lanes. The objective is to safely guide the bikes to the far side of the bridge within 50 turns. Each turn, you can send instructions to all bikes, including speeding up, slowing down, jumping, waiting, moving up, or moving down. There are holes on the bridge that bikes may fall into if not navigated properly. Going up or down increases the risk of falling into holes. Success is determined by the minimum number of bikes reaching the far side without too many falling into holes or failing to cross the entire bridge within the given turns.

## Approach

### State Representation
- Represent the current state of the game, including bike positions, speeds, and other relevant information.
- Use a 2D array to represent the bridge and track the positions of bikes and holes.

### Graph Representation
- Model the problem as a graph, where each state is a node, and possible moves are edges.
- Use graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), to explore possible sequences of moves.

### Dynamic Programming
- Utilize dynamic programming to memoize states and optimize the evaluation of repeated configurations.
- Keep track of the minimum number of bikes required to reach the far side in each state.

### Simulation
- Simulate the execution of instructions for each bike in each turn.
- Evaluate the outcome of each simulation, considering bike movements, jumps, and the presence of holes.

### Constraint Handling
- Implement logic to handle constraints, such as avoiding moves that could lead to bikes falling into holes or not reaching the destination within the specified turns.

Combining these data structures and algorithms can help create a robust solution to the puzzle, optimizing the chances of success and minimizing the risk of failure.
