# NETWORK CABLING

The puzzle requires you to optimize the layout of cabling to connect a list of houses on a grid, aiming to minimize the length of cable used. You will need to understand concepts such as average, median, distances, loops, and medians to solve this puzzle effectively.

The puzzle assumes you have knowledge of loops, which are programming constructs used to repeat a set of instructions. You may need to use loops to iterate over the list of houses or perform other repetitive tasks.

Understanding distances is crucial as you'll need to calculate the distance between different houses on the grid. This knowledge will help you determine the optimal placement of the cabling.

The concept of medians will also come into play. The puzzle might require you to find the median Manhattan distance, which is a measure of the central tendency of distances on a grid. Understanding how to calculate and work with medians will be essential.

By utilizing these concepts effectively, you can solve the puzzle by finding the most efficient arrangement of cabling, connecting all the houses while using the minimum length of cable possible.
