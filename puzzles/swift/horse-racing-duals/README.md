# Documentation

The following documentation provides an explanation of the Swift code provided.

```swift
import Glibc
import Foundation
```

The code imports the Glibc and Foundation modules.

```swift
public struct StderrOutputStream: TextOutputStream {
    public mutating func write(_ string: String) { fputs(string, stderr) }
}
public var errStream = StderrOutputStream()
```

This code defines a struct `StderrOutputStream` that conforms to the `TextOutputStream` protocol. It provides an implementation of the `write` method to write the given string to the standard error stream (`stderr`). An instance `errStream` is created, which can be used to write to the standard error stream.

```swift
if let n = readLine(), let nInt = Int(n) {
    var strengths: [Int] = []
    var minDiff = 10000000

    for _ in 0..<nInt {
        if let strengthStr = readLine(), let strength = Int(strengthStr) {
            strengths.append(strength)
        }
    }

    strengths.sort()

    for i in 0..<(nInt - 1) {
        let diff = strengths[i + 1] - strengths[i]
        if diff < minDiff {
            minDiff = diff
        }
    }

    print(minDiff)
}
```

This code reads an integer `n` from the standard input using `readLine()`, and converts it to an integer value `nInt` using `Int(n)`. If the conversion is successful (`n` is not `nil`), the code initializes an empty array `strengths` and sets the initial value of `minDiff` to 10,000,000.

Next, a loop is executed `nInt` times. Inside the loop, the code reads a string `strengthStr` from the standard input using `readLine()`, and converts it to an integer value `strength` using `Int(strengthStr)`. If the conversion is successful (`strengthStr` is not `nil`), the code appends the `strength` value to the `strengths` array.

After the loop, the `strengths` array is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.

Another loop is executed `nInt - 1` times. Inside the loop, the code calculates the difference between the current element and the next element in the sorted `strengths` array, and stores it in the `diff` variable. If the `diff` value is less than the current `minDiff`, the `minDiff` value is updated to the `diff` value.

Finally, the minimum difference (`minDiff`) is printed to the standard output using `print()`.

This code is used to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements in a list of numbers.
