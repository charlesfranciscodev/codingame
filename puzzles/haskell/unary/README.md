# Unary

"Unary" is a beginner-level coding challenge available on the CodinGame platform. In this challenge, the player is given a string of characters representing a unary number, and is asked to convert it to decimal notation.

A unary number is a number system in which each integer is represented by a corresponding number of symbols or characters. In this challenge, the unary number is represented by a string of the same character, and the value of the number is equal to the length of the string.

The challenge consists of writing a program that takes as input a string of characters representing a unary number and outputs the corresponding decimal notation.
