This Go code uses a `for` loop to continuously read input from standard input and print the name of the closest enemy.

In each iteration of the loop, we use the `Scan` function from the `fmt` package to read in the name and distance of the first enemy into the `enemy1` and `dist1` variables, respectively. We do the same for the second enemy, storing their name and distance in the `enemy2` and `dist2` variables.

We then compare the distances of the two enemies, and print the name of the one that is closest. The `Scan` function reads input from standard input and automatically parses the input into the specified variable types.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for {
        var enemy1, enemy2 string
        var dist1, dist2 int
        fmt.Scan(&enemy1, &dist1, &enemy2, &dist2)

        if dist1 < dist2 {
            fmt.Println(enemy1)
        } else {
            fmt.Println(enemy2)
        }
    }
}
```
