# DEFIBRILLATORS

## Description

Welcome to the Geographic Coordinates Decoder challenge! In this puzzle, you'll need to utilize a blend of string manipulation, mathematical computations, and trigonometry to pinpoint the closest location to a set of given geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

Your task is to write a program that takes latitude and longitude inputs and outputs the name of the closest location from a provided list.

## Learning Opportunities

1. **Loops:** Employ loops to iterate over a list of locations.
2. **Distances:** Calculate distances between coordinates using trigonometric functions and mathematical operations.
3. **Trigonometry:** Convert degrees to radians and utilize trigonometric functions for distance calculations.

## Challenge Statement

Your program will receive the latitude and longitude of a point. Following that, it will receive the number of locations to consider. For each location, it will be provided with its name, latitude, and longitude. Your task is to determine the closest location to the given coordinates and print its name.
