# Mayan Calculation

Mayan Calculation is a coding challenge on the website Codingame that requires the implementation of a Mayan numeral system calculator. The challenge is rated medium difficulty and is designed to test a developer's ability to work with numbers and string manipulation.

The Mayan numeral system is a base-20 system that was used by the Maya civilization. It consists of a combination of bars and dots, with each bar representing five units and each dot representing one unit. The challenge requires the implementation of a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the Mayan numeral system.

The input to the program is a string that represents the Mayan numeral. The program needs to parse the input string and convert it into an integer. The output of the program should also be a Mayan numeral string that represents the result of the arithmetic operation.

The challenge involves parsing and manipulating strings to perform arithmetic operations. It also requires a good understanding of the Mayan numeral system and how to convert it into a decimal system that is used by most modern calculators. Overall, the Mayan Calculation challenge is a fun and challenging way to improve one's string manipulation and arithmetic skills.
