# Unary

The function reads a line of text from the console using Console.ReadLine and assigns it to the text variable. It then calls the ToBinary method with text as the argument to convert the text to its binary representation. The binary representation is passed to the ToUnary method, which converts it to its unary representation. Finally, the unary representation is displayed on the console using Console.WriteLine.
