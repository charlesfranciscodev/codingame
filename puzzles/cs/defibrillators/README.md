# Defibrillators

"Defibrillators" is a beginner-level coding challenge available on the CodinGame platform. In this challenge, the player is given the location of a person and the location of several defibrillators in a city, and is asked to determine the closest defibrillator to the person.

The input contains the location of the person as longitude and latitude, as well as the longitude and latitude of each defibrillator and its name. The player is asked to calculate the distance between the person and each defibrillator using the Haversine formula, which takes into account the curvature of the Earth's surface.

The challenge consists of writing a program that takes as input the location of the person and the locations of the defibrillators, and outputs the name of the closest defibrillator to the person.

The challenge is designed to help players learn and practice programming skills such as geographic coordinate manipulation, distance calculation, and data structures. It is a fun and engaging way to improve programming skills while solving a challenging and entertaining puzzle.
