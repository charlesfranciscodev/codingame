# Super Computer

The Super Computer puzzle on Codingame is a programming challenge where the goal is to schedule a set of tasks on a number of available processors, maximizing the number of tasks that can be completed within a given timeframe. 

The input for the puzzle consists of the number of tasks and the amount of time required to complete each task. The output is the maximum number of tasks that can be scheduled within a given timeframe.

To solve this puzzle, you need to implement an efficient algorithm to schedule the tasks. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that sorts the tasks in descending order based on their duration, and then assigns each task to the processor with the earliest available finish time.

As you progress through the puzzle, you will encounter various edge cases that will test the robustness of your algorithm. Overall, the Super Computer puzzle is a great way to practice your programming skills and algorithmic thinking.
