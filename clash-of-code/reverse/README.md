## Overview

The REVERSE game mode on Codingame is a unique challenge where participants are presented with a set of tests but without access to the original problem statement. The goal is to deduce and implement the correct solution based solely on the provided input-output examples.

In this mode, you don't have access to the problem description, and your task is to observe the given test cases and decipher the underlying logic or algorithm that needs to be implemented. It requires a combination of logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and programming skills.

## How to Play

1. **Observation:** Study the provided input-output examples carefully. Understand the patterns and relationships between the inputs and corresponding outputs.

2. **Inference:** Deduce the rules or logic governing the transformation from input to output. Identify the core algorithm or operations required to achieve the desired results.

3. **Implementation:** Write a program that incorporates the deduced logic to solve the problem.

4. **Testing:** Run your program against the provided test cases to verify if your implementation produces the expected results.

5. **Submission:** Once you are confident in your solution, submit your code for evaluation. Codingame will assess the correctness and efficiency of your implementation.

Sure, let's consider a hypothetical example in markdown format:

## Example

You are given a series of test cases without access to the original problem statement. Your task is to deduce the underlying logic and implement the correct solution based on the provided input-output examples.

### Test Case 1:

**Input:**
```
3
```

**Output:**
```
6
```

### Test Case 2:

**Input:**
```
5
```

**Output:**
```
120
```

### Solution

Upon analyzing the provided test cases, we can deduce that the given input represents a number `n`, and the output corresponds to the factorial of that number (`n!`).

- Test Case 1: \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\)
- Test Case 2: \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\)

In this way, by recognizing the factorial pattern within the provided examples, we can deduce and implement the correct solution without having access to the original problem statement.

## Conclusion

The REVERSE game mode on Codingame offers a unique and challenging way to develop problem-solving skills. It encourages participants to think critically, analyze patterns, and implement solutions without relying on explicit problem statements. Good luck and happy coding!
