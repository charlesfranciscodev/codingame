# Jump Cycle Check

**Puzzle Statement:**

You are given an array A of length N. Each element of the array represents the index to jump to next. You start at index 0 and repeatedly jump to the index represented by the current element until you either return to index 0 or enter a cycle.

Write a Python function `can_return_to_first_element(N, A)` that takes in the length of the array `N` and the array `A`, and returns whether it is possible to return to the first element (index 0) or if the jumps create a cycling pattern.

**Solution Description:**

The provided Python function `can_return_to_first_element(N, A)` solves the given problem by utilizing the concept of checking for cycles in a sequence of jumps. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize a boolean array `visited` of length N to keep track of visited indices. Initialize all elements of `visited` to False.
2. Start from index 0 (`current_index = 0`).
3. Loop until we encounter a visited index.
4. Inside the loop, mark the current index as visited (`visited[current_index] = True`) and update `current_index` to the index specified by `A[current_index]`.
5. If during the process, we revisit index 0, the function returns "returns", indicating that it's possible to return to the first element.
6. If we encounter a cycle, i.e., a visited index is revisited before reaching index 0, the function returns "cycling", indicating that the jumps create a cycling pattern.
7. If the loop terminates without encountering a cycle or reaching index 0, it implies that it's not possible to return to the first element.
8. The function returns the appropriate result.

**Usage:**

To use this function:

1. Provide the length of the array `N`.
2. Input the array `A` of length `N`, where each element represents the index to jump to next.
3. The function will output either "returns" if it's possible to return to the first element or "cycling" if a cycling pattern is detected.

Ensure that the input adheres to the constraints and the input format specified in the puzzle statement.
