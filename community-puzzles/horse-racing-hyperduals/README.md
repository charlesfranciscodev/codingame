## Description

The Closest Pair Distance puzzle aims to find the smallest distance between any two points among a given set of points in a 2D plane. The puzzle provides a function to calculate the distance between two points and requires finding the minimum distance among all pairs of points.

## Tips

- **Optimization**: Utilize efficient algorithms to minimize the time complexity of distance calculation. Consider approaches like Divide and Conquer (e.g., the Closest Pair algorithm) to optimize the solution.

- **Data Structures**: Explore the use of appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, tuples) to store and manipulate the points efficiently.

- **Edge Cases**: Test the script with various input sizes, including edge cases like minimum and maximum possible inputs, to ensure robustness and correctness of the solution.
